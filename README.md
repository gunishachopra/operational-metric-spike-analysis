# ⚙️ Operational Analytics & Metric Spike Investigation

This project focuses on operational analytics and metric spike detection using SQL. It includes two case studies: one from a customer-care platform, and another from a user-based product resembling WhatsApp. The analysis helps answer business-critical questions like:  
- Why did user engagement dip?  
- Which features are under/over-utilized?  
- How can we improve throughput and user retention?
